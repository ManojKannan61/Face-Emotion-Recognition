# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Face Emotion Recognition is a crucial task in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence. This project aims to identify and classify human emotions from images of facial expressions. It leverages deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in recognizing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

Features:

i. Pre-trained Models: Use pre-trained models to quickly get started with emotion recognition.

ii. Custom Training: Train your own models using provided scripts and datasets.

iii. Real-time Emotion Detection: Implement real-time emotion detection using a webcam.

iv. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of models using standard metrics.

Model Architecture:

The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to extract features from facial images and classify them into different emotion categories. The architecture includes:

1.Convolutional layers for feature extraction

2.Pooling layers for downsampling

3.Fully connected layers for classification
